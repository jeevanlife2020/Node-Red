## Working flow:

*  **Inject** node is automatically triggered in a interval of specific time.

* Once **Inject** node gets triggered, **Total_usage** random node is called. Where a random number is generated within the specific range.

* From **Total_usage** node a function is getting called where total_usage is stored in payload variable.
